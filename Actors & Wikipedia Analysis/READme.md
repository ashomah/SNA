This assignment focuses on the 2 datasets mentioned below. Is an introduction to the basic functions and metrics of Social Networks. The R package used is called **iGraph**. 

*  Actors dataset - undirected graph - : For the 2005 Graph Drawing conference a data set was provided of the IMDB movie database. We will use a reduced version of this dataset, which derived all actor-actor collaboration edges where the actors co-starred in at least 2 movies together between 1995 and 2004.

*  Wikipedia Dataset - directed graph - . The vertices of this network are wikipedia pages. The label of each vertex is the title of the wikipedia page. Edges represent hyperlinks between wikipedia pages; that is, if there is an edge from page A to page B, it means that page A has an hyperlink to page B. The dataset is available at: https://www.cs.upc.edu/~CSN/lab/wikipedia.gml
